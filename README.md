### [claude-history-tool](https://github.com/andyfischer/ai-coding-tools/tree/main/claude-history-tool#readme) ###

Electron based application that allows you to browse the full history of every Claude Code session.

### [candle](https://github.com/andyfischer/ai-coding-tools/tree/main/candle#readme) ###

This is a small process manager for running local servers, with MCP integration.
I wrote this because Claude Code was having a lot of trouble launching local servers by itself.
