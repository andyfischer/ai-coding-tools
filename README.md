### Candle ###

This is a small process manager for running local servers, with MCP integration.
I wrote this because Claude Code was having a lot of trouble launching local servers by itself.

### ts-rubberstamp ###

First experiment using Claude Code hooks. This looks for certain Typescript edits
that are generally always safe (such as adding 'import' statements) and it auto-approves them.
